## Overview
The **Check-ComplianceMultipleAppsFilesGenerator** is a **GUI-based tool** designed to simplify the creation of **Intune compliance detection scripts** for multiple applications. This tool allows IT administrators to easily define compliance rules for **application presence or version requirements**, ensuring compliance with corporate policies.

The generator produces **PowerShell scripts and JSON configuration files** that can be used as **custom compliance policies in Microsoft Intune**. This eliminates the need for manual script writing and ensures consistency across managed devices.

## Example Output

### üîπ **Generated PowerShell Script**
Example **Check-ComplianceMultipleApps.ps1**:
```powershell
$AppNames = @("Google Chrome", "Zoom", "Microsoft Edge")
$foundApps = @()

foreach ($app in $AppNames) {
    $installed = Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
                 Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -match $app }

    if ($installed) {
        $foundApps += $app
    }
}

if ($foundApps.Count -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "Non-compliant: $($foundApps -join ', ') found."
    exit 1
} else {
    Write-Host "Compliant: No unauthorized applications detected."
    exit 0
}
```

### üîπ **Generated JSON Compliance Rule**
Example **Check-ComplianceMultipleApps.json**:
```json
{
    "Rules":  [
        {
            "SettingName":  "Google Chrome",
            "Operator":  "GreaterEquals",
            "DataType":  "Version",
            "Operand":  "133.0.6943.54",
            "MoreInfoUrl":  "https://www.google.com/chrome/",
            "RemediationStrings":  [
                {
                    "Language":  "en_US",
                    "Title":  "Google Chrome is outdated or not installed.",
                    "Description":  "Please install or update Google Chrome."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deployment in Intune
To enforce compliance policies in **Microsoft Intune**, follow these steps:

1. **Upload `Check-App-Presence.ps1`** as a detection script in Intune.
2. **Upload `Check-App-Presence.json`** as the compliance policy rule.
3. Assign the compliance policy to the **targeted device groups**.
4. Monitor compliance results in **Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune)**.
