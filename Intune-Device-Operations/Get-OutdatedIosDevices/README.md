# 📖 Overview

**Get Outdated iOS Devices Report** is a PowerShell script that Connects to Microsoft Graph and retrieves Intune-managed iOS devices, including their assigned user and last check-in date. Devices with an iOS major version lower than the older of the two supported major releases are exported to a timestamped CSV file. The supported major versions can be updated by parameter when Apple releases a new major version. Workstation authentication modes: - Interactive (default): auto-installs Microsoft.Graph.Authentication if missing and connects with delegated scopes via Connect-MgGraph / Connect-MgGraphCommunity (WAM-free when available). - App-only (optional): provide -TenantId, -ClientId and either -ClientSecret or -CertificateThumbprint for unattended service-principal authentication. Pass -TenantId, -ClientId and -ClientSecret (or -CertificateThumbprint) together to use app-only; otherwise interactive delegated authentication is used.

Pass -TenantId, -ClientId and -ClientSecret (or -CertificateThumbprint) together to use app-only; otherwise interactive delegated authentication is used. It runs **against Microsoft Graph via workstation authentication (interactive delegated through MgGraphCommunity or app-only with client credentials)** and writes structured logs for every operation.

* Windows 10 / Windows 11

### PowerShell
* PowerShell **5.1 or later** (`#Requires -Version 5.1`)

### Modules
* `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` (auto-installed if missing; `MgGraphCommunity >= 1.4.0` for WAM-free interactive sign-in)

### Permissions
* `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` — grant exactly the listed delegated or application permissions and consent as admin before running.

### Logging
* `C:\ProgramData\get-outdated-ios-devices-report\Logs`

# 🛡️ Operational Notes

* Remote bulk operations support `-DryRun` / `-WhatIf` previews — use them before any write or destructive action.
* Graph scripts honor HTTP 429 throttling with 60-second back-off and support pagination via `Get-MgGraphAllPages`.
* CSV bulk operations are idempotent; re-running the same CSV without changes is a no-op.
* Test in a staging tenant or on a pilot Entra group before production; export reports for change control.
