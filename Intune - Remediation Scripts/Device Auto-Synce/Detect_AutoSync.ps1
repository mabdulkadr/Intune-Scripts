.SYNOPSIS
    Detection script to check for Intune device synchronization issues.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script retrieves the last synchronization time of the "PushLaunch" scheduled task used for Intune device management.
    It calculates the time difference between the last run and the current time to identify devices that have not synchronized
    for more than 2 days. Such devices may require remediation to stay compliant with Intune policies.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Detect_AutoSync.ps1
