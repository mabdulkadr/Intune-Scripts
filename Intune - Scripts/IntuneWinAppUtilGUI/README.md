**IntuneWinAppUtilGUI** is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the **Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool**, a tool that packages Win32 applications for deployment via **Microsoft Intune**. This utility simplifies the application packaging process by providing a user-friendly interface, making it easier for IT administrators to package and deploy applications in an Intune-managed environment.

## Overview

The **IntuneWinAppUtilGUI** script leverages the **Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool** (`IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`) and wraps it with a GUI for easier packaging of applications for deployment through Intune. By streamlining the process of creating `.intunewin` files, this tool saves time and reduces potential errors in application packaging.

4. **Choose Output Folder**:
   - Specify the folder where you want the `.intunewin` file to be saved.

5. **Create Package**:
   - Click the **Package** button to start the packaging process.
   - The tool will use `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` to create the `.intunewin` package, which will be saved to the specified output folder.

6. **Deploy to Intune**:
   - Once the `.intunewin` file is created, it can be uploaded to Microsoft Intune for deployment.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`**: Ensure `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` is in the same directory as the GUI.
