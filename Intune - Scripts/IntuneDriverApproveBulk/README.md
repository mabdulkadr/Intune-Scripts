This repository contains two PowerShell scripts that automate the approval of pending Windows driver updates in Microsoft Intune using the Microsoft Graph API.

- **`IntuneDriverApproveBulk.ps1`**: Uses user-based authentication (supports MFA).
- **`IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1`**: Uses app-based authentication with Azure AD application credentials.

## Overview

Managing driver updates in an enterprise environment can be complex and time-consuming. These scripts simplify the process by automating the approval of Windows driver updates that require review in Microsoft Intune.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.
- **PowerShell Version**: 5.1 or higher (PowerShell Core is also supported).
- **Microsoft .NET Framework**: 4.7.2 or later.
- **Network Access**: Internet connectivity to access the PowerShell Gallery and Microsoft Graph API.
- **Azure AD Account/App Registration**:
  - For user-based authentication: An account with the necessary permissions.
  - For app-based authentication: An Azure AD application with appropriate permissions and admin consent.

## Scripts Description

### IntuneDriverApproveBulk.ps1

- **Authentication Method**: User-based authentication (supports MFA).
- **Purpose**: Connects to Microsoft Graph using a user account, fetches pending driver updates, and approves them for deployment in Intune.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where you prefer to authenticate interactively or when MFA is enforced.

### IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1

- **Authentication Method**: App-based authentication using Azure AD application credentials.
- **Purpose**: Connects to Microsoft Graph using app credentials (Tenant ID, App ID, App Secret), fetches pending driver updates, and approves them for deployment in Intune.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for automation scenarios where interactive sign-in is not feasible, such as scheduled tasks or CI/CD pipelines.


## Usage

### Using IntuneDriverApproveBulk.ps1

#### Steps:

1. **Run the Script**:

   ```powershell
   .\IntuneDriverApproveBulk.ps1
   ```

2. **Authentication Prompt**:

   - A sign-in window will appear.
   - Log in with your Azure AD account that has the necessary permissions.
   - Complete any MFA prompts if required.

3. **Script Execution**:

   - The script will install any missing modules.
   - It will connect to Microsoft Graph.
   - Fetch driver updates needing review.
   - Approve the drivers for deployment.
   - Disconnect from Microsoft Graph upon completion.

4. **Monitoring Progress**:

   - The console will display messages indicating the progress and any errors encountered.
   - Successful approvals will be highlighted in green.
   - Any failures will be highlighted in red.

### Using IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1

#### Steps:

1. **Prepare Azure AD App Registration**:

   - **Register an Application** in Azure AD.
   - **Assign API Permissions**:
     - `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` (Application permission).
   - **Grant Admin Consent** for the application permissions.
   - **Generate a Client Secret** and note the value.

2. **Update Script Parameters**:

   - Open `IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1` in a text editor.
   - Replace the placeholder values in the `param` block at the top of the script with your actual credentials:

     ```powershell
     param (
         [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
         [string]$TenantID = "your-tenant-id",

         [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
         [string]$AppID = "your-app-id",

         [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
         [string]$AppSecret = "your-app-secret"
     )
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   ```powershell
   .\IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1
   ```

   Alternatively, pass the parameters directly:

   ```powershell
   .\IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1 -TenantID "your-tenant-id" -AppID "your-app-id" -AppSecret "your-app-secret"
   ```

4. **Script Execution**:

   - The script will install any missing modules.
   - It will connect to Microsoft Graph using app-based authentication.
   - Fetch driver updates needing review.
   - Approve the drivers for deployment.
   - Disconnect from Microsoft Graph upon completion.

5. **Monitoring Progress**:

   - Similar to the user-based script, monitor the console output for progress and errors.

## Permissions

- **For User-Based Authentication**:
  - **Azure AD Role**: Intune Administrator or equivalent.
  - **Microsoft Graph Permissions**: `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` (Delegated permission).
- **For App-Based Authentication**:
  - **Azure AD App Registration** with:
    - **Application Permission**: `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All`.
    - **Admin Consent** granted for the permission.

## Authentication Methods

- **User-Based Authentication**:
  - Interactive login.
  - Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Requires a user account with necessary permissions.
- **App-Based Authentication**:
  - Non-interactive login using client credentials flow.
  - Suitable for automation and scripts running unattended.
  - Requires Azure AD app registration with appropriate permissions.

## Script Breakdown

Both scripts perform the following actions:

1. **Module Installation and Import**:
   - Ensures that the necessary Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules are installed and imported:
     - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
     - `Microsoft.Graph.Beta.DeviceManagement.Actions`

2. **Authentication**:
   - **IntuneDriverApproveBulk.ps1**: Uses `Connect-MgGraph` with user-based authentication.
   - **IntuneDriverApproveBulk-AppAuth.ps1**: Includes a `Connect-ToGraph` function to authenticate using app credentials.

3. **Fetching and Approving Driver Updates**:
   - Retrieves all Windows driver update profiles.
   - For each profile, fetches driver inventories needing review.
   - Approves each driver by executing the "Approve" action via Microsoft Graph API.
   - Handles pagination to process all drivers.

4. **Disconnecting**:
   - Cleanly disconnects from Microsoft Graph to free up resources.

## Error Handling

- **Module Installation Errors**:
  - If a module fails to install, the script outputs an error message and exits.
- **Driver Approval Errors**:
  - If a driver fails to approve, the script outputs an error message but continues processing other drivers.
- **General Exceptions**:
  - The scripts use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

## Security Considerations

- **App Secrets**:
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like `AppSecret` in scripts.
  - Consider using secure methods to store and retrieve secrets, such as Azure Key Vault or encrypted credential stores.
- **Script Storage**:
  - Store scripts securely and restrict access to authorized personnel.
- **Version Control**:
  - If using version control systems (e.g., Git), ensure that secrets are not committed to the repository.
- **Testing**:
  - Always test scripts in a non-production environment before running them in production.
